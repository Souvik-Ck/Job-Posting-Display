Business Need: 
 Recruiters need an efficient way to view and manage active job postings within the Recruitment App. 
 The current process involves navigating through multiple pages and lists, making it difficult to quickly find relevant postings. 
 We want to provide a user-friendly interface that displays a consolidated list of active job postings with key details and filtering capabilities. 


Functional Requirements: 
 
1. Job Posting List Display: 
* The interface should display a list of all active 'Job Posting' records. 
* Each list item should include the following details: 
* Job Title 
* Location 
* Department 
* Number of Open Positions (from the 'Total Open Positions' field) 
* Posting Date 
* Any other relevant fields as identified 

1. Filtering: 
   Recruiters should be able to filter the list of job postings by 'Department'. 
   The filtering mechanism should be intuitive and easy to use. 

1. User Experience: 
  The interface should be visually appealing and adhere to Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) principles. 
  Consider providing sorting options for the list (e.g., by Job Title, Posting Date). 


Technical Requirements: 
 
* Lightning Web Component (LWC): 
  Develop an LWC to implement the job posting list display and filtering functionality. 



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adhere to Cloudkaptan LWC Coding Standards and Best Practices, including: 
  Clear and descriptive component and method names. 
  Separation of concerns (UI, data access, logic). 
  Use of Lightning Data Service (LDS) or UI API for efficient data retrieval. 
  Lazy loading or conditional rendering for performance optimization. 
  Error handling and user-friendly error messages. 
  Thorough unit testing with Jest. 


Additional Considerations: 
 
* Error Handling: 
  Implement error handling to gracefully manage potential issues during data retrieval or filtering. 
  Display user-friendly error messages to guide users in case of errors. 

* Testing: 
 Write comprehensive Jest tests to cover various scenarios, including: 
 Data retrieval and display. 
 Filtering functionality. 
 Error handling. 
 User interactions. 

* Cloudkaptan LWC Guidelines - Highlights: 
* Compose Components: Leverage base components and existing reusable components whenever possible. 
* Component Communication: Use appropriate communication mechanisms (properties, events, LMS) based on the component hierarchy and data flow. 
* Styling: Utilize SLDS for styling and responsiveness. 
* Performance: Optimize performance through lazy loading, conditional rendering, and efficient data retrieval. 
* Security:
